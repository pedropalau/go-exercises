# go-exercises

```
This is a WIP repository
```

The repository contains some exercises implementations and code exploration for the `go` language.

## Executing the exercises

For executing the exercises, is required to have the `go` [compiler](https://golang.org/doc/install/source#go14) correctly installed on your system.

To execute an exercise you can use the command:

```
$ go run [filename].go
```

Where `filename` is the name of the file you want to execute.
